    <p>A scanner is a device that converts physical documents, images, or objects into digital format, allowing them to be stored, edited, and shared electronically. Scanners come in various types, including flatbed scanners, sheet-fed scanners, and handheld scanners, each designed for specific applications.

        Flatbed scanners are common in offices and homes, featuring a flat, glass surface where the document or image is placed for scanning. This type is versatile and suitable for scanning books, photos, or delicate documents. Sheet-fed scanners, on the other hand, are designed to handle multiple pages fed through a roller system, making them efficient for high-volume document scanning.
        
        Handheld scanners provide portability and flexibility, allowing users to scan objects or documents by manually moving the scanner over the material. These are often used for capturing images of larger objects or in situations where a stationary scanner is impractical.
        
        Scanners use various technologies, including contact image sensors (CIS) or charge-coupled devices (CCD), to capture the details of the physical material. Optical character recognition (OCR) software is commonly employed to convert scanned text into editable and searchable digital text.
        
        Scanners play a crucial role in digitizing and preserving a wide range of content, from important documents to cherished photos. They are essential tools for archiving, sharing, and manipulating information in the digital age. Advances in scanning technology continue to improve speed, resolution, and ease of use, making scanners integral components in both personal and professional settings.
