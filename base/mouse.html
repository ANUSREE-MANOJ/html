    <p>A computer mouse is a pointing device that allows users to interact with a computer by moving a cursor on a screen and clicking on icons or buttons. Typically consisting of two buttons (left and right) and a scroll wheel, mice come in various designs and functionalities. The left mouse button is the primary control for selecting and activating items, while the right button often opens context menus or performs secondary functions. The scroll wheel facilitates easy navigation through documents or web pages. Modern mice may also have additional buttons for customizable functions, catering to specific user preferences or gaming needs. Optical or laser sensors on the bottom of the mouse track movement, providing accurate and responsive control. Wireless mice use technologies like Bluetooth or radio frequency to connect to a computer, offering greater flexibility in movement. Ergonomic designs aim to enhance comfort during prolonged use. The mouse plays a fundamental role in the user interface, contributing to a seamless and intuitive interaction with digital environments.</p>
